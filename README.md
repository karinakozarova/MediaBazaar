## Goal
The main goal of the project is to develop a Centralised Software Management System for overview of the employee work shifts over the span of the week, per department, per shift. The application will be displaying all available work shifts, the workload, the hours covered and the costs of the employees being available at those times. The administration will be handling the attendance and the scheduling as well as managing the depot including viewing shelf restock requests. The companyâ€™s management will be tracking the employee statistics, departments and stock.

## Deliverables
The products which we will deliver to the client are the following:
- a software solution for managing employee administration including attendance and scheduling. Through that application the company will be able to manage their depot and view the shelf restock requests
 - a software solution for managing the departments. The software will also display statistics about employees, departments and stock
- wireframes of the website for the company employees where they can log in and view their work shifts and adjust their personal information
- source code for all the solutions
